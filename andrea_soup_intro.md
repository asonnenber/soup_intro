## Stuff and things about me
I'm a taurus sun, cancer moon and pisces rising which means I'm very stubborn, beyond emotional and have my head in the clouds. 

I have a Culinary Arts diploma from NAIT that I received in 2014. I went back to school a few years later and graduated from my undergrad at the University of Alberta in 2021 with a BA Honors in Classics. As for work, I have been a Materials Handling Clerk in the Collections, Management and Access Division at the Edmonton Public library since 2015.

My academic interests are vast. I am interested in the history and classics spheres, library and archival material, game studies, digital mapping, text analysis, data analysis, databases, engineering and math in general, and so so much more. 
 

# What is a soup?
![soup](https://media1.tenor.com/m/qapxiS4W66kAAAAd/soup-mode-seinfeld.gif)

I have so many feelings about this question and have done a lot of deep thinking about what a soup is over the last twelve years. My thoughts on this matter are that if it is an edible savory dish that __must__ be put into some sort of hemispehere container in order to serve it where it can be easily consumed with a utensil, then it's a soup. It's typically eaten in quantities of ___about___ 1 - 2 cups (250 mL - 500 mL). Soup does __not__ have to be hot as we see with [__gazpachos__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazpacho), which are pureed cold soups. Soup can also be either chunky and pureed, as indicated above ⬆️. 

Because it is a liquid/semi-liquid, it is typically eaten with a spoon, or simply sipped/eaten straight from the hemisphere-shaped serving dish with no utensils. You can use your hand too if you want since the palm of your hand can be shaped into a hemisphere, but if the soup is hot, I'd stay away from that option.

Non-toxic inedible ingredients can be included on top of the soup as garnishes, including stones (for stone soup) and parsley (if you're feeling fancy). ⬅️ _(That last one was a joke based on garnishes popularized in the 1960s-1970s)._

All of this comes from discussions I've had about soup since my schooling at NAIT. I used to think that as long as a dish was a liquid with some chunks/chunkiness then it was a soup, but [_Something Something Soup Something_](https://soup.gua-le-ni.com/) has made me realize that it needs to be savory for it to feel like a soup in my mind. I also had not thought about garnishes or even utensil usage for soup until playing *Something Something Soup Something* game which definitely helped in forming my new personal definition for soup. 


#### Btw, a hotdog __IS__ a sandwich.
